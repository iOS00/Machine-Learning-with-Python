Bank Loan Defaulters Prediction Model
DESCRIPTION
Financial institutions incur significant losses due to the default of vehicle loans. This has led to the tightening up of vehicle loan underwriting and increased the vehicle loan rejection rates. The need for a better credit risk scoring model among these institutions also gets created. This warrants a study to estimate the determinants of vehicle loan default.
There is one dataset data that has 41 attributes.
You are required to determine and examine factors that affect the ratio of vehicle loan defaulters. Also, use the findings to create a model to predict the potential defaulters.
